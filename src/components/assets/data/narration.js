Verdant valleys stretch between the mountains, with a sense of mystique emanating from the fog-covered peaks."

The other three could be a bridge suspended over a turbulent ocean, a mountain pass covered in snow, and a futuristic hyperloop track stretching out under a starry, otherworldly sky. Reflect the journey's sense of perseverance, solitude, and endless exploration"
